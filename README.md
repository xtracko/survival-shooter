## Survival Shooter
  * Level 1 by Unity (F1)
  * Level 2 by Jiří Novotný (F2) - Feature Bombs
  * Level 3 by Oliver Pačut (F3) - Portals
  * Level 3 by Kristína Zákopčanová (F4) - Potions

### Feature Bombs
  * After either icon in bottom left corner lights up, press 'space' to drop the bomb.
  * Changes - various parameters adjusted (thresholds, timers, damage...)

### Portals
  * Telepads are placed around the level, and the player can use them to move around instantly
  * Changes - Added new assets

### Potions
  * After you kill a Hellephant, a potion appears lying on the ground. Walk towards the potion to pick it up and heal yourself.
  * Changes - Spawn points are eventually in the original locations. After implementing my original intent, the course of the game did not match my ideas with regard to how I wanted to use a narrow passage in the Lego bricks.
